Hello! This is an HTML comment.

<h1>Welcome to HTML! (This is a heading)</h1>
<p>
	HTML is a very versatile plain text based document format and it's an open standard! (This is a paragraph).
</p>
<p>
	HTML is more than a way to share text documents. You can add images, sound, video, and even behavior.
</p>
<p>
	Instead of thinking of only <em>pages</em> as what we can make with HTML, <strong>we can consider our HTML works as interactive projects</strong>.
